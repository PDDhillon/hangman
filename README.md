# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 


# Milestone 2
This milestone lays the foundations for the hangman game. I started by defining a list of my favourite fruits. Using python's in-built module "random", i choose a random record from this list and print to the terminal.

Next using the built in input function, I prompted the user to give me a single character. I then validated that input to make sure it was alphabetical, as well as length 1.
